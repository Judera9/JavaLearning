How to run Rain:
It contains a main method in "Rain.java", and here is the steps to run it:

1. "cd" to the directory that contains Rain.java
2. Use "javac Rain.java" to compile
(NOTE: Rain.class has already been compiled by me, so the steps 1 & 2 can be overlooked)

3. Use command line argument "java Rain tests.txt" to run default test file
4. For more tests, change the argument to "java Rain moreTests.txt"

5. The code supported for having more than one arguments for once, for example:
"java Rain tests.txt moreTests.txt" could also work, and the results of different files are separated in lines
